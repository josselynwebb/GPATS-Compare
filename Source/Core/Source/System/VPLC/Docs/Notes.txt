Need to go through the SICL at least for the RF Generator.
Need to deal with new EADS drivers for RF GEn and how they deal
 with the SAIF loss data.

Legacy system has the following characteristics:
Start Frequency = 100Mhz.
End Frequency = 8.5Ghz.
Frequency step size = 100Mhz.
Total number of calibration factors generated for each frequency is 85.
With all the paths taken into account the total measurements taken is 1,360.

Proposed system shall have the following characteristics:
Start Frequency = 100Mhz.
End Frequency = 18.1Ghz.
Frequency step size = 200Mhz.
Total number of calibration factors generated for each frequency is 90.
With all the paths taken into account the total measurements taken is 1,440.
Test time approxamatly 5.6% > than legacy system.
Since the increase in attenuation is very linear with increase in frequency,
 linear interpilation shall be used to find correction factors which lie
 between two points in the measured data.
