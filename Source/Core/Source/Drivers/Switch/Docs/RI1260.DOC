  Error and Status Information:

  Error codes and warnings are returned as the return value of each instrument
  driver function. A program should examine this value after each call to an
  instrument driver function to determine if any error occurred.  The general
  meaning of the return value is as follows:

       Value                   Meaning
       -------------------------------
       0                      Success
       Positive Values        Warnings
       Negative Values        Errors

  Possible error codes and their meanings are listed with the corresponding
  instrument driver function.

       The driver modules are divided into the following categories:
      
       (1) Initialize Function
           This function is used to initialize the instrument.  This
           consists of establishing an I/O session with the resource
           manager, identifying which switch modules are present and
           putting the instrument into it's power-on default state.
      
       (2) Application Functions
           These are high level functions that utilize low level
           driver functions to demonstrate their usage and provide
           a higher level of functionality.
      
       (3) Configure Functions
           These functions configure the system for a variety of
           operations switching and digital operations.
           Switching Configuration:

             - Arm and disarm syncronous testing
             - Define which ports are in write mode and which are
               in read mode
             - Define how many ports are to be used in synchronous
               testing
             - Define the polarity of the handshake lines
             - Specify the number of reads for each synchronous read
               port
             - Specify the data to be written out on each synchronous
               write port
      
       (4) Action-Status Functions
           These functions cause the instrument to initiate various
           operations or obtain the current status of the instrument:
             - Read the instrument status byte
             - Operate multiple relays for a module
             - Operate a single relay for a particular module
             - Read from or write to a Digital I/O module
             - Get the configuration status of a Digital I/O module
      
       (5) Data Functions
           These functions cause the instrument to transfer data
           related to each module:
             - Retreive data from a synchronous operation on a
               Digital I/O module
             - Read the states of all the relays for a particular
               switch module
             - Get the card types associated with the module addresses
      
       (6) Utility Functions
           These functions perform utility operations:
             - Reset the switch to a known state
             - Perform the self-test
             - Query the instrument for firmware and driver revision
               information
             - Query the instrument to determine if it has detected
               an error
             - Convert an error number returned from a driver to a
               more descriptive error
               message
             - Find all the 1260 controllers installed in the system
             - Close all of the I/O links to the resource manager to
               free up system resources
      
       (7) Close
           This function terminates the software connection between
           the resource manager and the instrument.

                     CLKIN and BUSY handshake protocol.
      
                     This function allows for either an
                     8-bit byte or a 16-bit word to be
                     read.
      
                     When a 16-bit word is read, the
                     port number parameter must be an
                     even-numbered port.  This port is
                     used to read the least significant
                     8 bits of the 16-bit word.  The
                     next highest numbered port is used
                     to read the most significant 8
                     bits.

      Description:   This panel is used to close out all existing
                     resource manager functions.  This function is
                     useful when the "There are too many sessions
                     open" error has occured.  This condition can
                     occur when multiple 1260 sessions have been
                     opened to the same or different 1260's and the
                     subsequent closes have not been accomplished.
                     The maximum number of simultaneous 1260 resource
                     manager sessions that may be open is 12.
      
      WARNING: This function will close EVERY 1260 session that is
               open.  If this is not desireable, close the sessions
               individually using the ri1260_close function.  This
               function is meant as a last resort when there are
               no available sessions and the existing instrument
               handles have been lost.

  Purpose

      Panel Name:    Define Equate List
      
      Description:   This panel defines one or more sets
                     of relay modules are to be equated.
                     When a relay module is equated with
                     others, an attempt to open or close
                     a relay on that module causes all
                     other equated modules to open or
                     close the same relay.
      
                     Note:  Defining an equate list
                     overwrites any previously defined
                     equate list.

           Description:       Holds a list of modules which
                              are to be equated.  When one

                              another, opening (or closing)
                              a relay on one card will open
                              (or close) the same relay on
                              the equated card.
          
           Variable Type:     ViChar [] (ViString)
                              Maximum length: 250 characters
          
           Variable Format:
          
              The Equate List String consists of one or
              more groups or modules.  Each module is
              identified by the module address of that
              module.
          
              The general format for the Equate List is
          
                 "<list-1> [, <list-2> , ... , <list-N> ]"
          
              where each <list> is a list of module
              addresses for the switch modules which are to
              be equated.
          
              Each <list> has the format:
          
                  "<module-1> ; <module-2> ; <module-3> ..."
          
              where each <module> is an integer in the range
              1 - 12.  Contiguous modules may be specified
              by using the hyphen:
          
                  "<first module> - <last module>"
          
              Thus the equate list string:
          
                  "1;2;3,4;5;6;7"
          
              Equates modules 1, 2, and 3 as one equate
              group and modules 4, 5, 6, and 7 as another
              equate group.  This could alternatively be
              specified as:
          
                  "1;2;3,4-7"
          
              or
          
                  "1-3,4-7".
          
              NOTE:  All relay modules which belong to an
              equate group must be of the same model.  That
              is, it is not permitted to equate a 1260-12
              with a 1260-13.
          
              NOTE:  An Equate List of "0" clears all
                     equate lists

  Purpose

      Panel Name:    Define Exclusion List
      
      Description:   This panel defines one or more sets
                     of switches which are to be con-
                     sidered mutually exclusive from
                     each other.  When switches are
                     mutually exclusive, an attempt to
                     close one switch will cause the
                     others to be opened automatically.
      
                     The switch sequence, as defined
                     by the 'Set Switch Sequence' panel,
                     affects the order in which the
                     excluded relays are opened.
      
                     Note:  Defining an exclusion list
                     overwrites any previously defined

          Variable Type       ViChar []

           Control Name:      Exclude List String
          
           Description:       Indicates a list of relays
                              which are to be considered
                              mutually exclusive from one
                              another.  When one switch
                              in an exclusion list is
                              closed, all others on the
                              exclusion list are opened,
                              in the order specified by
                              the 'Switch Sequence' panel.
          
           Variable Type:     ViChar [] (ViString)
                              Maximum length: 250 characters
          
           Variable Format:
          
              The Exclude List String consists of one or
              more lists of relays.  Each list identifies
              a group of relays which are to be considered
              mutually exclusive from each other.  The
              general format for an entire exclusion list
              is
                  <list-1> E; <list-2> E; ... E; <list-N>
          
              Note that multiple lists must be separated
              by the characters "E;".  Each <list> uses
              the format:
          
                  <module-1> , <module-2> , ... , <module-M>
          
              Each <module> identifies a particular module
              and set of relays.  The general format for the
              <module-M>
              is:
          
                  <mod_num>.<relay range>[,<relay range>...]
          
              where <mod_num> identifies a particular relay
              module address, and is in the range 1 through
              12.  <relay range> identifies a particular relay
              or range of relays on the module.  The format
              for the <relay range> is:
          
                  <start relay>[-<end relay>]
          
              where the value of <start relay> and <end relay>
              depends upon the module type.  For example:
          
             For the 1260-13, the <relay> value ranges
             between "00" and "39".   Thus, the relay
             descriptor  "5.12" refers to relay 12 on the
             1260-13 module whose address is 5.
          
             For the 1260-20, the <relay> value ranges
             between "00" and "19".   Thus, the relay
             descriptor  "7.04" refers to relay 4 on the
             1260-20 module whose address is 7.
          
             For the 1260-30, the <relay> value format is:
          
                 <group> <relay num>
          
             where <group> is a 1 digit number and the
             <relay num> is a 2 digit number.  The range of
             values accepted for <group> and <relay num>
             depends on the 1260-30 configuration:
          
                 Model        Group Range     Relay Range
                 1260-30A        0 (only)      00  -  39
                 1260-30B        0 - 1         00  -  19
                 1260-30C        0 - 3         00  -  09
                 1260-30D        0 - 7         00  -  04
          
              So, the relay descriptor "8.503" refers to the
              relay on the module whose address is 8, which
              is in group 5, relay 3.
          
              For the 1260-40, the <relay> format is:
          
                   <matrix><row><column>
          
              where <matrix> is a 1 digit matrix number, row
              is a 1 digit row number, and column is a 2
              digit column number.  The range of values
              depends on the 1260-40 configuration:
          
                 Model      Matrix      Row        Column
                 1260-40A   0 (only)    0-3        00 - 23
                 1260-40B   0 (only)    0-7        00 - 11
                 1260-40C   0 - 1       0-3        00 - 11
          
              An example of a valid exclusion list, with a
              1260-20 with an address of 1, a 1260-30C

                                     ViInt16 relaystoGroup[], ViInt16 numbertoGroup);

  Purpose

      Panel Name:    Define Inclusion List
      
      Description:   This panel defines which relays on a module
                     will be included on an "include" list.  There
                     are only a few modules which support this
                     feature (notably, the 1260-18).
      
                     When 2 or more relays are defined on an
                     "include" list, operating one of the relays
                     causes all of the included relays to be
                     placed in the same (closed or opened) state.
      
                     Through multiple uses of this function, multiple
                     relay include groups may be defined.  If the
                     "Number to Group" parameter of this function is
                     0, all existing include groups are erased.

  Parameter List

      instrHandle

          Variable Type       ViSession

           Control Name:  Instr Handle
          
           Description:   The Instrument Handle is used to
                          identify the unique session or
                          communication channel between the
                          driver and the instrument.
          
                          If more than one instrument of the
                          same model type is used, this
                          Handle will be used to
                          differentiate between them.
          
           Variable Type: ViSession

      moduleAddress

          Variable Type       ViInt16

                              function.
          
                              The module address is NOT the
                              logical address of the switch
                              controller.  It selects one
                              of the switch modules
                              controlled by the switch
                              controller.  The module
                              address is set on a module by
                              a DIP switch.

           Valid Range:       1  to  12

      relaystoGroup

          Variable Type       ViInt16 []

           Control Name:      Relays To Group
          
           Description:       Holds the list of relays to group together.
                              The relays are described by the "relay
                              descriptor" used to control the relay.
                              For the 1260-18, each relay is in the
                              range 0 to 151.
          
                              If the "Number in Group" parameter is 0,
                              all presently defined include groups for
                              all modules will be erased.
          
                              If the "Number in Group" parameter is 1,
                              an error will be returned, since a group
                              must consist of 2 or more relays.
          
                              Each relay may be placed on at most 1
                              include group.  If a relay is placed on
                              multiple groups (through multiple uses
                              of this function), then the 1260 option
                              01 smart card will generate an error.
                              For the sake of efficiency, this function
                              DOES NOT CHECK if a relay is already on
                              an existing include group.

                              in the "Relays to Group" parameter.
          
           Valid Range:       0, 2 - 152.  1 is NOT ALLOWED.
          
                              A value of 0 erases all existing include
                              groups.  A value of 2 or more indicates
                              the number of relays defined in the
                              "Relays to Group" parameter.

                              closed (instrument state
                              recalled) in response to a
                              trigger.  As one relay on
                              the scan list is closed, the
                              previous one is opened.
          
           Variable Type:     ViChar [] (ViString)
                              Maximum length: 250 characters
          
           Variable Format:
          
            The Scan List String contains a list of
            instrument states, breakpoints, and relay
            descriptors.  Each of these is separated on
            the list by a semicolon.
          
            Instrument states to be recalled are denoted by
            a positive integer value in the range 1 to 50.
          
            Breakpoints are denoted by the value 0.
          
            Relay descriptors indicate the module number
            and the relay on the module which is to be
            closed.  The general format of a relay
            descriptor is:
          
                <module>.<relay range>[,<relay range>...]
          
            where <module> is an integer in the range 1 to
            12. <relay range> identifies a particular relay
            or range of relays on the module.  The format for
            <relay range> is:
          
                 <start relay>[-<end relay>]
          
            where the eact value of <start relay> and <end relay>
            depends upon the module type.  For example:
          
            For the 1260-13, the <relay> value ranges
            between "00" and "39".   Thus, the relay
            descriptor  "5.12" refers to relay 12 on the
            1260-13 module whose address is 5.
          
            For the 1260-20, the <relay> value ranges
            between "00" and "19".   Thus, the relay
            descriptor  "7.04" refers to relay 4 on the
            1260-20 module whose address is 7.
          
            For the 1260-30, the <relay> value format is:
          
                <group> <relay num>
          
            where <group> is a 1 digit number and the
            <relay num> is a 2 digit number.  The range of
            values accepted for <group> and <relay num>
            depends on the 1260-30 configuration:
          
                 Model        Group Range     Relay Range
                 1260-30A        0 (only)      00  -  39
                 1260-30B        0 - 1         00  -  19
                 1260-30C        0 - 3         00  -  09
                 1260-30D        0 - 7         00  -  04
          
             So, the relay descriptor "8.503" refers to the
             relay on the module whose address is 8, which
             is in group 5, relay 3.
          
             For the 1260-40, the <relay> format is:
          
                  <matrix><row><column>
          
             where <matrix> is a 1 digit matrix number, row
             is a 1 digit row number, and column is a 2
             digit column number.  The range of values
             depends on the 1260-40 configuration:
          
                 Model      Matrix      Row        Column
                 1260-40A   0 (only)    0-3        00 - 23
                 1260-40B   0 (only)    0-7        00 - 11
                 1260-40C   0 - 1       0-3        00 - 11
          
             An example of a valid Scan List String, with a
             1260-20 card at address 1, a 1260-30C at
             address 2, and a 1260-40A card at address 3 is
          
                "3.0104;0;2.309;31;1.13-15;0;35;3.0220"
          
             The example shows 2 breakpoints, and a recall
             of instrument states from memory locations 31
             and 35, in addition to the relay closures.
          
             See the 1260 Series Instruction Manual for
             detailed information about the relay syntax
             used with other 1260 switch cards.
          
             Note, to erase the currently defined scan
             list, the Scan List String "0" is used.

                              port's output buffer is
                              diabled.  When defined as an
                              output port, the output buffer
                              is enabled.
          
                              The value returned for this
                              parameter is in the form of a
                              bit mask.  Bit 0 corresponds
                              to the input/output mode for
                              port 0, and Bit 11 corresponds
                              to the input/output mode for
                              port 11.
          
                              For each port, a 1 in the
                              port's bit assignment
                              indicates that the port is
                              an output port, and a 0
                              indicates that the port is
                              an input port.
          
                              For example, a value of 1027
                              (decimal = 403 hex) would
                              indicate that ports 0, 1, and
                              10 are enabled as outputs,
                              while all other ports are
                              enabled as inputs.

                                       ViInt16 portNumber, ViInt16 dataLength,
                                       ViInt16 maxDataItems);

  Purpose

      Panel Name:    Setup Synchronous Read
      
      Description:   This function sets up the card to
                     perform a synchronous read
                     operation.  Two consecutive ports
                     may be grouped together to perform
                     16-bit read operations.
      
                     When two ports are grouped, the
                     port number parameter must be an
                     even-numbered port.  This port is
                     used to read the least significant
                     8 bits from the 16-bit port.  The
                     next highest numbered port is used
                     to read the most significant 8
                     bits.
      
                     This function may only be executed
                     when the digital I/O card is
                     disarmed.

  Purpose

      Panel Name:    Setup Synchronous Write
      
      Description:   This function sets up the card to
                     perform a synchronous write
                     operation.  The data length and the
                     data bytes (words) to transmit are
                     also defined with this function.
      
                     Two consecutive ports may be
                     grouped together to perform a
                     16-bit (word) write operation.
                     When two ports are grouped, the
                     Port Number parameter must be an
                     even-numbered port.  This port is
                     used to write the least significant
                     8 bits from the 16-bit port.  The
                     next odd-numbered port is used
                     to write the most significant 8
                     bits.
      
                     This function may only be executed
                     when the digital I/O card is
                     disarmed.

  Purpose

      Panel Name:    Setup Sync/Async Modes
      
      Description:   This function defines which
                     ports use synchronous and which
                     ports use asynchronous
                     communication.
      
                     When synchronous mode is active,
                     the card must be ARMed before data
                     transfer will occur.
      
                     When this function is executed, any
                     ports which change from synchronous
                     to asynchronous (or vice versa) are
                     re-initialized.  Thus, these ports
                     will lose any data established with
                     a synchronous read/write operation.
