________________________________________________________________________________

  Introduction:

  This instrument driver provides programming support for HPE1428A Digitizing Oscilloscope (VISA).
  It contains functions for opening, configuring, taking measurements from, and
  closing the instrument.

________________________________________________________________________________

  Assumptions:

  To successfully use this module, the following conditions must be met:

  For GPIB instrument drivers:
         -  the instrument is connected to the GPIB.
         -  the GPIB address supplied to the initialize function must match the
            GPIB address of the instrument.

  For VXI instrument drivers:
         -  the instrument is installed in the VXI mainframe and you are
            using one of the following controller options:
            Embedded controller
                  AT-MXI
                  MC-MXI
                  GPIB-VXI
         -  the logical address supplied to the initialize function must
            match the logical address of the instrument.
         -  if you are using GPIB-VXI, there must be at least one unused
            device name in the handler.

  For RS-232 instrument drivers:
         -  the instrument is connected to the RS-232 interface.
         -  the COM port, baud rate, parity, and timeout supplied to the
            initialize function must match the settings of the instrument.

________________________________________________________________________________

  Error Codes:

  Error codes are returned as the return value of each instrument driver
  function. A program should examine this value after each call to an instrument
  driver function to determine if any error occurred. Possible error codes and
  their meanings are listed with the corresponding instrument driver function.

                                          instrumentHandle As ViSession)

  Purpose

      This function performs the following initialization actions:
      
      - Opens a session to the Default Resource Manager resource and a session
      to the specified device using the interface and address specified in the
      Resource_Name control.
      
      - Performs an identification query on the Instrument.
      
      - Resets the instrument to a known state.
      
      - Sends initialization commands to the instrument that set any necessary
      programmatic variables such as Headers Off, Short Command form, and Data
      Transfer Binary to the state necessary for the operation of the
      instrument driver.
      
      - Returns an Instrument Handle which is used to differentiate between
      different sessions of this instrument driver.
      
      - Each time this function is invoked a Unique Session is opened.  It is
      possible to have more than one session open for the same resource.
      

  Parameter List

      ByVal resourceName As ViRsrc

          This control specifies the interface and address of the device that
          is to be initialized (Instrument Descriptor). The exact grammar to be
          used in this control is shown in the note below.
          
          Default Value:  "VXI::24"
          
          Notes:
          
          (1) Based on the Instrument Descriptor, this operation establishes a
          communication session with a device.  The grammar for the Instrument
          Descriptor is shown below.  Optional parameters are shown in square
          brackets ([]).
          
          Interface   Grammar
          ------------------------------------------------------
          VXI        VXI[board]::primary address[::secondary address]
                      [::INSTR]
          
          The VXI keyword is used with VXI instruments.
          
          The default value for optional parameters are shown below.
          
          Optional Parameter          Default Value
          -----------------------------------------
          board                       0
          secondary address           none - 31
          

      ByVal IDQuery As ViBoolean

          This control specifies if an ID Query is sent to the instrument
          during the initialization procedure.
          
          Valid Range:
          VI_OFF (0) - Skip Query
          VI_ON  (1) - Do Query (Default Value)
          
          Notes:
          
          (1) Under normal circumstances the ID Query ensures that the
          instrument initialized is the type supported by this driver. However
          circumstances may arise where it is undesirable to send an ID Query
          to the instrument.  In those cases; set this control to "Skip Query"
          and this function will initialize the selected interface, without
          doing an ID Query.

      ByVal resetDevice As ViBoolean

          This control specifies if the instrument is to be reset to its
          power-on settings during the initialization procedure.
          
          Valid Range:
          VI_OFF (0) - Don't Reset
          VI_ON  (1) - Reset Device (Default Value)
          
          Notes:
          
          (1) If you do not want the instrument reset, set this control to
          "Don't Reset" while initializing the instrument.

      instrumentHandle As ViSession

          This control returns an Instrument Handle that is used in all
          subsequent function calls to differentiate between different sessions
          of this instrument driver.
          
          Notes:
          
          (1) Each time this function is invoked a Unique Session is opened.
          It is possible to have more than one session open for the same
          resource.
          

  Return Value

          This control contains the status code returned by the function call.
          
          Status Codes:
          
          Status    Description
          -------------------------------------------------
                 0  No error (the call was successful).

  hpe1428a_readInstrData

      Function hpe1428a_readInstrData As ViStatus (ByVal instrumentHandle As
                                                   ViSession,
                                                   ByVal numberBytesToRead As
                                                   ViInt16,
                                                   readBuffer As ViChar,
                                                   numBytesRead As ViInt32)

  Purpose

      This function reads data from the instrument's output buffer and returns
      it to the specified variable in memory.
      
      Notes:
      
      (1) Because the instrument may return both numeric and text data in
      response to queries this function returns the data in string format.
      
      (2) If valid data is not available at the instrument's output buffer when
      this function is called the instrument will hang up and the function will
      not return until it times out.  If the time-out is disabled this function
      will hang indefinitely and it may be necessary to reboot the computer to
      break out.

  Parameter List

      ByVal instrumentHandle As ViSession

          This control accepts the Instrument Handle returned by the Initialize
          function to select the desired instrument driver session.
          
          Default Value:  None

      ByVal numberBytesToRead As ViInt16

          The number of bytes specified by this control should be greater than
          or equal to the number of bytes which are to be read from the
          instrument. If the actual number of bytes to be read is greater than
          the number this control specifies then multiple reads will be
          required to empty the instrument's output buffer.
          
          If the instrument's output buffer is not emptied the instrument may
          return invalid data when future reads are performed.
          
          Default Value:  50 (See NOTE 2)
          
          Notes:
          
          (1) If NO DATA is available at the instrument's output buffer when
          this function is called the instrument will hang up and the function
          will not return until it times out.  If the time-out is disabled,
          this function will hang indefinitely and it may be necessary to
          reboot the computer.
          
          (2) If the number of bytes expected is greater than 50 the value of
          this control may be increased. If the actual number of bytes read is
          larger than the declared size of the read buffer a run-time error
          will be generated.
          

      readBuffer As ViChar

          The incoming data from the instrument is placed into this variable.
          
          Notes:
          
          (1) Because the instrument may return both numeric and text data in
          response to queries this function returns the data in string format.
          
          (2) This function does not overwrite any old data left in the string
          variable from the last time the function was called. String data in
          LabWindows/CVI is terminated with an ASCII null(0x0) and string
          manipulation functions will only recognize data before the ASCII
          null.
          
          (3) The declared size of the string variable must be greater than the
          actual number of bytes read from the instrument if it is not a
          run-time error will be generated.
          

      numBytesRead As ViInt32

          This variable contains the actual number of bytes read from the
          instrument. This is the value which is returned by the read function.
          
          Notes:
          
          (1) If the actual number of bytes read is less than the number of
          bytes specified in the Number Bytes To Read control then the output
          buffer has probably been emptied. If the read function fails and the
          number of bytes read is 0, the most probable cause for the failure is
          there was no data available at the instrument's output buffer.

  Return Value
