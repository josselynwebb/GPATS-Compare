________________________________________________________________________________

  Introduction:

  This instrument driver provides programming support for RI4152A Digital Multimeter.
  It contains functions for opening, configuring, taking measurements from, and
  closing the instrument.

________________________________________________________________________________

  Assumptions:

  To successfully use this module, the following conditions must be met:

  For GPIB instrument drivers:
         -  the instrument is connected to the GPIB.
         -  the GPIB address supplied to the initialize function must match the
            GPIB address of the instrument.

  For VXI instrument drivers:
         -  the instrument is installed in the VXI mainframe and you are
            using one of the following controller options:
                  Embedded controller
                  MXI
                  MXI2
                  GPIB-VXI
         -  the logical address supplied to the initialize function must
            match the logical address of the instrument.

  For RS-232 instrument drivers:
         -  the instrument is connected to the RS-232 interface.
         -  the COM port, baud rate, parity, and timeout supplied to the
            initialize function must match the settings of the instrument.

  Error and Status Information:

  Error codes and warnings are returned as the return value of each instrument
  driver function. A program should examine this value after each call to an
  instrument driver function to determine if any error occurred.  The general
  meaning of the return value is as follows:

       Value                   Meaning
       -------------------------------
       0                      Success
       Positive Values        Warnings
       Negative Values        Errors

  Possible error codes and their meanings are listed with the corresponding
  instrument driver function.

  RI4152A Digital Multimeter

      Instrument: Racal 4152A 6.5 Digit Multimeter
      
      Description: The Racal 4152A is a 6.5 Digit Multimeter which performs
      measurements on voltage, current, resistance, frequency, and period,
      among other measurements.  The Racal 4152A is a VXI C-Size module.
      
      Minimum Firmware Revision: 1.0

  ri4152a_abor

      ViStatus ri4152a_abor (ViSession instrHandle);

  Purpose

      Panel Name: Abort Measurement
      
      Aborts a measurement in progress, the trigger system is returned to the
      idle state.  No other settings are affected.  It is only effective when
      the trigger source is BUS.
      
      Note:
      
      Abort does not affect any other settings of the trigger system.  When the
      INITiate command is sent, the trigger system will respond as it did
      before ABORt was executed.
      
      ABORt returns the multimeter to the idle state for TRIG:SOUR BUS.  The
      "Trigger ingored" error is generated when a Group Execute Trigger bus
      command or *TRG common command is executed after an ABORt command (which
      puts the multimeter into the idle state).
      
      

  Parameter List

      instrHandle

          Variable Type       ViSession

           Control Name:  Instr Handle
          
           Description:   The Instrument Handle is used to
                          identify the unique session or
                          communication channel between the
                          driver and the instrument.
          
                          If more than one instrument of the
                          same model type is used, this
                          Handle will be used to
                          differentiate between them.
          
                          NOTE:  A new (unique) handle will be

      This routine returns some statistical data on all readings taken since
      the AVERage function was enabled.  The data returned are the average
      value of readings, the minimum reading, the maximum reading, and the
      number of readings taken.  Each of these data parameters is individually
      available as well through a separate function call (i.e. the minimum
      value can be obtained by calling the function ri4152a_averMin_Q ).

      aperture

          Variable Type       ViReal64

          Control Name: Aperture
          
          Sets the integration time in seconds (aperture) for DC current
          measurements. Input values are rounded UP to the nearest aperture
          time shown in the table below.
          
          Aperture is one of three ways to set the resolution of the reading.
          The other two are currDcRes and currDcNplc.  The relationships
          between range, resolution, aperture and NPLC's (Number Power Line
          Cycles) is shown below.
          
          Aperture is determined by the NPLC setting; for example, for 1 power
          line cycle of 60 Hz power, the aperture is 16.7 milliseconds, for 10
          PLCs, it is 167 milliseconds.  If the power source were 50 Hz instead
          of 60 Hz, the above numbers would be 20.0 milliseconds and 200
          milliseconds respectively.
          
          In the following table, resolution is shown as a function of range
          and integration time given in Power Line Cycles (PLCs).  The
          associated aperture is shown for 60 Hz power.

  ri4152a_currDcRes

      ViStatus ri4152a_currDcRes (ViSession instrHandle, ViReal64 resolution);

  Purpose

      Panel Name: DC Current Resolution Setup
      
      Selects the resolution for DC current measurements.
      
      Note: Must change range first.
      
      See also the ri4152a_currDcAper and ri4152a_currDcNplc functions because
      changing resolution affects the setting on those two functions as well
      (they are coupled).

      resolution

          Variable Type       ViReal64

          Control Name: resolution
          
          Specifies the resolution for DC current measurements.  Note that
          resolution is really determined by aperture or NPLC settings, and so
          the minimum aperture on A GIVEN RANGE determines the resolution; thus
          10 nanoVolts of resolution is only possible on the lowest range, and
          if selected on a higher range will result in an error from the
          instrument.  See the table below for the settings possible.
          
          Also, selecting a resolution changes the aperture and NPLC settings,
          see the second table below for the interactions of Range, Resolution,
          Aperture, and NPLCs.

  ri4152a_initImm

      ViStatus ri4152a_initImm (ViSession instrHandle);

  Purpose

      Panel Name: Initiate Measurement
      
      Places the multimeter in the wait-for-trigger state and stores readings
      in multimeter memory when a trigger occurs. The new readings replace the
      readings in memory from previous commands.
      
      After the trigger system is initiate using INITiate, use the TRIGger
      command subsystem to control the behavior of the trigger system.
      
      If the TRIGger:SOURce is IMMediate, the measurement starts and readings
      are stored in interanl memory as soon as INITiate is executed.  Readings
      stored in memory from preivous commands are replaced by the new readings.
      
      To transfer readings from memory to the output buffer, use the FETCh?
      command.
      
      If TRIGger:SOURce is not IMMediate, the measurement starts as soon as a
      trigger is received either from the external BNC connector, the VXIbus
      backplane (TTLT<n> trigger lines) or a BUS trigger.
      
      The READ? command executeds INITiate implicitly.  The MEASure command
      executes READ? implicitly.  Executing READ? outputs data directly to the
      output buffer, bypassing the multimeter's internal memory.

  Purpose

      Panel Name: Read Using Present Settings
      
      Places the multimeter in the wait-for-trigger state and transfers
      readings directly to the output buffer after receiving a trigger.
      Because multimeter memory is not used to store the readings, there is no
      restriction on the sample count and trigger count.  Because the readings
      are formatted before being sent to the output buffer, the sample rate is
      not as high as the one attainable using the ri4152a_initImm and
      ri4152a_fetc_Q routines.

      aperture

          Variable Type       ViReal64

          Control Name: Aperture
          
          Sets the integration time in seconds (aperture) for resistance
          measurements. Input values are rounded UP to the nearest aperture
          time shown in the table below.
          
          Aperture is one of three ways to set the resolution of the reading.
          The other two are resRes and resNplc.  The relationships between
          range, resolution, aperture and NPLC's (Number Power Line Cycles) is
          shown below.
          
          Aperture is determined by the NPLC setting; for example, for 1 power
          line cycle of 60 Hz power, the aperture is 16.7 milliseconds, for 10
          PLCs, it is 167 milliseconds.  If the power source were 50 Hz instead
          of 60 Hz, the above numbers would be 20.0 milliseconds and 200
          milliseconds respectively.
          
          In the following table, resolution is shown as a function of range
          and integration time given in Power Line Cycles (PLCs).  The
          associated aperture is shown for 60 Hz power.

      resolution

          Variable Type       ViReal64

          Control Name: resolution
          
          Specifies the resolution for resistance measurements.  Note that
          resolution is really determined by aperture or NPLC settings, and so
          the minimum aperture on A GIVEN RANGE determines the resolution; thus
          10 nanoVolts of resolution is only possible on the lowest range, and
          if selected on a higher range will result in an error from the
          instrument.  See the table below for the settings possible.
          
          Also, selecting a resolution changes the aperture and NPLC settings,
          see the second table below for the interactions of Range, Resolution,
          Aperture, and NPLCs.

  Parameter List

      instrHandle

          Variable Type       ViSession

           Control Name:  Instr Handle
          
           Description:   The Instrument Handle is used to
                          identify the unique session or
                          communication channel between the

                          differentiate between them.
          
                          NOTE:  A new (unique) handle will be
                          returned EACH time the Initialize
                          function is called.  The ri4152a_close()

  Purpose

      Panel Name: Trigger Setup
      
      
      
      This routine sets up the trigger system with a single function call.
      Note that each of the trigger settings in this call may also be set
      individually by the function of a similar name as the parameter (i.e.
      trigger source can also be set by function ri4152a_trigSour() ).

  Parameter List

      instrHandle

          Variable Type       ViSession

           Control Name:  Instr Handle
          
           Description:   The Instrument Handle is used to
                          identify the unique session or
                          communication channel between the
                          driver and the instrument.
          
                          If more than one instrument of the
                          same model type is used, this
                          Handle will be used to
                          differentiate between them.
          
                          NOTE:  A new (unique) handle will be
                          returned EACH time the Initialize
                          function is called.  The ri4152a_close()
                          call should be used for EACH handle
                          returned by the ri4152a_init() function.
          

      count

          Variable Type       ViInt32

          Control Name: Count
          
          Specifies the trigger count.  This is the number of "bursts" of
          samples that will be taken.  Normally, the multimeter only has enough
          memory to store 512 readings.  This limits the trigger count * number
          of samples to be <= 512. If you require more readings than this, see
          the ri4152a_read_Q function for a way to get data directly from the
          multimeter without storing the data into memory first.  The min and
          max values of trigger count are defined as macros shown below.

      autoDelay

          Variable Type       ViBoolean

          Control Name: autoDelay
          
          Enables (1) or disables (0) selection of an automatic trigger delay.
          This is the time period from receipt of the trigger until the start
          of the first reading.  The automatic delay varies by function, but
          may be changed by the user with the delay parameter when autoDelay is
          set to OFF (0).

      delay

          Variable Type       ViReal64

          Control Name: Delay
          
          This specifies the amount of time (in seconds) to delay after receipt
          of the trigger before taking the first sample.  This value is ignored
          if trigDelAuto is ON (1).  One reason for specifying a specific delay
          time is to allow extra time for a relay to settle when measurement
          signals are being switched (multiplexed) to the multimeter.
          
          If the sample count is > 1, this delay will also occur before EACH
          additional sample instead of only before the first sample.
          
          The min and max values for delay are shown below.

      source

          Variable Type       ViInt16

          Control Name: Source
          
          
          Selects the trigger source, as follows.
          
           Macro Name                   Value  Description

           ri4152a_TRIG_SOUR_TTLT7         10  TTL Trigger Line 7
          
          The TRIGger:SOURce command only selects the trigger source.   You
          must use the INITiate command to place the multimeter in the
          wait-for-trigger state.  (The MEASure command automatically executes
          an INITiate command.)
          
          TRIGger:SOURce EXT uses the multimeter's front panel "Trig" BNC
          connector as the trigger source.  The multimeter triggers on the
          falling (negative-going) edge of a +/-5 V TTL input signal; (maximum
          input is +5V to the front panel BNC connector).
          
          TRIGger:IMMediate causes a trigger to occur immediately provided the
          multimeter is placed in the wait-for-trigger state using INITiate,
          READ? or MEAS?
          
          The READ? command cannot be used if the trigger source is TRIG:SOUR
          BUS

  Purpose

      Panel Name: Execute Immediate Trigger
      
      This function is used to send a trigger to the instrument.  Usually this
      is needed when the trigger source is set to HOLD or
      BUS, but this command will force a trigger no matter what the
      trigger source is set to if the instrument is in the wait-for-trigger
      state.
      
      For this command to complete without error, the instrument must have been
      previously initiated (usually via the ri4152a_initImm function) and must
      be in the wait-for-trigger state.  If the instrument has already received
      all of the triggers specified, or if it is not in the wait-for-trigger
      state, an error will occur.

      aperture

          Variable Type       ViReal64

          Control Name: aperture
          
          Sets the integration time in seconds (aperture) for DC voltage
          measurements. Input values are rounded UP to the nearest aperture
          time shown in the table below.
          
          Aperture is one of three ways to set the resolution of the reading.
          The other two are voltDcRes and voltDcNplc.  The relationships
          between range, resolution, aperture and NPLC's (Number Power Line
          Cycles) is shown below.
          
          Aperture is determined by the NPLC setting; for example, for 1 power
          line cycle of 60 Hz power, the aperture is 16.7 milliseconds, for 10
          PLCs, it is 167 milliseconds.  If the power source were 50 Hz instead
          of 60 Hz, the above numbers would be 20.0 milliseconds and 200
          milliseconds respectively.
          
          In the following table, resolution is shown as a function of range
          and integration time given in Power Line Cycles (PLCs).  The
          associated aperture is shown for 60 Hz power.
          
                --------------------------------------------------|
                | Integration time in Power Line Cycles (PLCs)    |

      nplc

          Variable Type       ViReal64

          Control Name: nplc
          
          Sets the integration time in Power Line Cycles (PLCs) for DC voltage
          measurements.  Input values are rounded UP to the nearest aperture
          time shown in the table below.
          
          NPLC is one of three ways to set the resolution of the reading.  The
          other two are voltDcRes and voltDcAper.  The relationships between
          range, resolution, aperture and NPLC's (Number Power Line Cycles) is
          shown below.
          
          Aperture is determined by the NPLC setting; for example, for 1 power
          line cycle of 60 Hz power, the aperture is 16.7 milliseconds, for 10
          PLCs, it is 167 milliseconds.  If the power source were 50 Hz instead
          of 60 Hz, the above numbers would be 20.0 milliseconds and 200
          milliseconds respectively.
          
          In the following table, resolution is shown as a function of range
          and integration time given in Power Line Cycles (PLCs).  The
          associated aperture is shown for 60 Hz power.

          Specifies the resolution for DC voltage measurements.  Note that
          resolution is really determined by aperture or NPLC settings, and so
          the minimum aperture on A GIVEN RANGE determines the resolution; thus
          10 nanoVolts of resolution is only possible on the lowest range, and
          if selected on a higher range will result in an error from the
          instrument.  See the table below for the settings possible.
          
          Also, selecting a resolution changes the aperture and NPLC settings,
          see the second table below for the interactions of Range, Resolution,
          Aperture, and NPLCs.

  ri4152a_voltDcRes_Q

      ViStatus ri4152a_voltDcRes_Q (ViSession instrHandle, ViReal64 *resolution);

  Purpose

      Panel Name: DC Voltage Resolution Query
      
      This routine queries the current setting of voltage resolution.

  Parameter List

      instrHandle

          Variable Type       ViSession

           Control Name:  Instr Handle
          
           Description:   The Instrument Handle is used to
                          identify the unique session or
                          communication channel between the
                          driver and the instrument.
          
                          If more than one instrument of the
                          same model type is used, this
                          Handle will be used to
                          differentiate between them.
          
                          NOTE:  A new (unique) handle will be
                          returned EACH time the Initialize
                          function is called.  The ri4152a_close()
                          call should be used for EACH handle
                          returned by the ri4152a_init() function.
          

      resolution

          Variable Type       ViReal64 (passed by reference)

          Control Name: Resolution
          
          Returns current DC voltage resolution.

  Return Value

          VI_SUCCESS: No error. Non VI_SUCCESS: Indicates error condition. To
          determine error message, pass the return value to routine
          "ri4152a_error_message"
