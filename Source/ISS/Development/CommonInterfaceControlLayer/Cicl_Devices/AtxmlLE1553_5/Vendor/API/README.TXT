     INTRODUCTION

          The C13W32.H and C13W32.LIB files are the C/C++
          language header and import library for the CM1553-3
          Driver API.  With these files, the user can write
          applications that operate the CM1553-3 PCMCIA
          MIL-STD-1553 card.  The Driver API has been tested
          using the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler Version
          6.0 and the Borland C++ Compiler Version
          4.5.

          The examples files are written in C and have been
          tested using the Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler
          Version 6.0 and the Borland C++ Compiler Version
          4.5.



     C13W32.H

          WIN32 applications written in the C or C++ language
          that use the CM1553-3 Driver API library must
          incorporate the header file C13W32.H using the
          #include preprocessor directive.  Assuming the
          header file is in the current working directory or
          in the INCLUDE path, the following line must be
          added to the top of the application's source file:

          #include "C13W32.H"



     C13W32VB.BAS

          WIN32 applications written in Microsoft Visual
          Basic can access the CM1553-3 Driver API by adding
          C13W32VB.BAS into the Visual Basic project.  Once
          added to the project, Driver API functions can be
          called along with other user-defined functions.



     C13W32BC.LIB

          C and C++ language applications developed with
          Borland tools cannot use the Microsoft import
          library C13W32.LIB.  Instead, Borland users should
          use C13W32BC.LIB.



     EXAMPLE PROGRAMS

          There are eight examples discussed in the CM1553-3
          User's Manual.  These examples, and others, are
          provided both in C source code files and 32-bit
          console executable files.

          Refer to the comments in each example source file
          and to the discussion in the CM1553-3 User's
          Manual.  The section number of each example is
          shown below:
