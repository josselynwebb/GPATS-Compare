________________________________________________________________________________

  Introduction:

  This instrument driver provides programming support for Racal 3152A Arbitrary Waveform Generator.
  It contains functions for opening, configuring, taking measurements from, and
  closing the instrument.

________________________________________________________________________________

  Assumptions:

  To successfully use this module, the following conditions must be met:

-  the instrument is installed in the VXI mainframe and you are
            using one of the following controller options:
                  Embedded controller
                  MXI
                  MXI2
                  GPIB-VXI
         -  the logical address supplied to the initialize function must
            match the logical address of the instrument.
         -  VISA must be loaded onto your system.  VISA is provided by
            the manufacturer of your VXI slot 0 interface.
            The power to the VXI chassis must be on
            The Resource Manager program must be executed after the
            VXI chassis power has been turned on.

________________________________________________________________________________

  Error and Status Information:

Error codes are returned as the return value of each instrument driver
  function. A program should examine this value after each call to an instrument
  driver function to determine if any error occurred. Possible error codes and
  their meanings are listed in Appendix B.3 of the VXIplug&play specification
  VPP 4.2 for VISA related errors and in the driver source code for 3151
  specific errors.  Note that the function "ri3152a_error_message" may be used
  to translate an error code returned from this driver into a descriptive
  error message

                level functions of this driver to produce a complete
                measurement value.  These functions illustrate the
                use of the other functions within the driver.
      
        (3)     Configure Functions
      
                Functions in this class configure the function
                generator to output specific waveforms, including
                standard and arbitrary waveform types.
      
        (4)     Action/Status Functions
      
                Functions in this class provide the capability of
                turning the generator on or off.  This class also
                includes a variety of functions used to query the
                present setup of the arbitrary waveform generator.
      
        (5)     Data Operations
      
                This class includes the functions used to define and
                download arbitrary waveform data blocks
      
        (6)     Utility Functions
      
                Functions in this class include the functions which
                are common to all VXIplug&play drivers.  These
                functions reset, perform a self-test, read the
                instrument and driver revision, perform an error
                query, and convert a numeric error code to a
                descriptive error message.
      
        (7)     Close
      
                This function closes the driver and releases the
                system resources (memory) which were allocated when
                the instrument was initialized.  This function should
                be called at the end of the application program before
                it terminates.

                          If more than one instrument of the
                          same model type is used, this
                          Handle will be used to
                          differentiate between them.
          
                          Note that the initialize function may
                          be used to associate multiple instrument

  ri3152a_init

      ViStatus ri3152a_init (ViRsrc instrDescriptor, ViBoolean IDQuery,
                             ViBoolean resetDevice, ViSession *instrHandle);

  Purpose

      
      Panel Name:    Initialize
      
      Description:   Initializes the instrument and returns and
                     "instrument handle".  The instrument handle
                     must be used with all of the other functions
                     of this driver.
      
                     The initialize call allows the instrument
                     to be queried to ensure that it is a 3152A
                     Arbitrary Waveform/Function Generator.
                     It also resets the 3152A to the power-up
                     state if the "Reset" parameter is True (ON).
      
                     Note that for each "ri3152a_init()" call, a new
                     unique instrument handle is returned.  Thus,
                     if four calls are made to the initialize
                     call in succession, four unique instrument
                     handles will be returned.  This driver supports
                     10 instances of instrument handles, so that
                     if this function is called 11 times consecutively
                     (with no call to ri3152a_close()), the 11th call
                     will fail.
      
                     For each instrument handle returned by the
                     "ri3152a_init()" function, the "ri3152a_close()"
                     function should be called to free up the
                     resources allocated by "ri3152a_init()".  The
                     call(s) to "ri3152a_close()" should be made
                     before the application program terminates.
      

  Parameter List

      instrDescriptor

          Variable Type       ViRsrc

           Control Name:  Instr Descriptor
          
           Description:   Specifies which remote instrument
                          to establish a communication
                          session with.  Based on the syntax
                          of the Instr Descriptor, the
                          Initialize function configures the
                          I/O interface and generates an
                          Instr Handle
          
           Default Value: "VXI::7::INSTR"
          
           Based on the Instrument Descriptor, this operation
           establishes a communication session with a device.
           The grammar for the Instrument Descriptor is shown
           below.  Optional parameters are shown in square
           brackets ([]).  The default value is for a VXI
           interface for logical address 7.  For a GPIB-VXI interface
           with the timer/counter set to logical address 19, the
           value should be:
          
                "GPIB-VXI::7::INSTR"
          
          
          Interface Grammar
          ----------------------------------------------------
          GPIB      GPIB[board]::primary address
                    [::secondary address][::INSTR]
          VXI       VXI[board]::VXI logical address[::INSTR]
          GPIB-VXI  GPIB-VXI[board][::GPIB-VXI primary address]
                    ::VXI logical address[::INSTR]
          
          The GPIB keyword can be used with GPIB instruments.

      IDQuery

          Variable Type       ViBoolean

           Control Name:  ID Query
          
           Description:   Specifies if an ID Query is sent
                          to the instrument during the
                          initialization procedure.
          
           Valid Range:   1 = Yes
                          0 = No
          
           Default Value: 1 - Yes
          
           NOTE:  Under normal circumstances the ID Query
                  insures that the instrument initialized
                  over the bus is the type supported by
                  this driver. However circumstances may
                  arise where it is undesirable to send an
                  ID Query to the instrument. In those
                  cases; set this control to Skip Query
                  and this function will initialize the
                  bus and the Command arrays in the driver,
                  without doing an ID Query.

      resetDevice

          Variable Type       ViBoolean

           Control Name:  Reset
          
           Description:   Specifies if the instrument is to
                          be reset to its power-on settings
                          during the initialization
                          procedure.
          
           Valid Range:   1 = Yes
                          0 = No
          
           Default Value: 1 - Yes
          
           NOTE: If you do not want the instrument reset.
                 Set this control to No while initializing
                 the instrument.

      instrHandle

          Variable Type       ViSession (passed by reference)

           Control Name:  Instr Handle
          
           Description:   The Instrument Handle is used to
                          identify the unique session or
                          communication channel between the
                          driver and the instrument.
          
                          If more than one instrument of the
                          same model type is used, this
                          Handle will be used to
                          differentiate between them.
          
                          NOTE:  A new (unique) handle will be
                          returned EACH time the Initialize
                          function is called.  The ri3152a_close()
                          call should be used for EACH handle
                          returned by the ri3152a_init() function.
          

  Return Value

           Control Name:  Error
          
           Description:   Displays the return status of the
                          function call.  If the function was

  ri3152a_load_and_shift_arb_data

      ViStatus ri3152a_load_and_shift_arb_data (ViSession instrHandle,
                                                ViInt16 segmentNumber,
                                                ViInt16 dataPointArray[],
                                                ViInt32 numberofPoints);

  Purpose

      
       Control Name:  Load/Shift Arbitrary Data
      
       Description:   Selects the arbitrary data segment and
                      loads data into the segment.  The data
                      is shifted left 4 places prior to loading
                      to convert DAC values in the range 0 to
                      4095 into values used by the 3152A hardware.
      
      
       NOTE:  This function is provided solely as an alternative
              to "ri3152a_load_arb_data()".  This function is
              provided for those languages, such as Visual BASIC,
              which do NOT support the VISA data type ViUInt16 [].
              For most users, the "ri3152a_load_arb_data()" is
              preferred because of the increased data download
              throughput.

  Parameter List

      instrHandle

          Variable Type       ViSession

           Control Name:  Instr Handle
          
           Description:   The Instrument Handle is used to
                          identify the unique session or
                          communication channel between the
                          driver and the instrument.
          
                          If more than one instrument of the
                          same model type is used, this
                          Handle will be used to
                          differentiate between them.
          
                          Note that the initialize function may
                          be used to associate multiple instrument
                          handles with a single instrument.
          

      segmentNumber

          Variable Type       ViInt16

           Control Name:  Segment Number
          
           Description:   Select the segment number.
          
           Valid Range:   1 to 4096
          
           Default:       1

      dataPointArray

          Variable Type       ViInt16 []

           Control Name:  Data Points []
          
           Description:   Select an array of data to be down loaded to
                          a specific memory segment.
          
           Data Range:    each point in the array represents a single
                          DAC value.  The DAC values range from:
          
                                0x0000 (0 decimal)      minimum to
                                0x0FFF (4095 decimal)   maximum
          
                          The middle of the range voltage is thus
                          produced with a value of 0x0800 (2048 decimal)
          
                          The value of 0x0000 represents the minimum
                          (most negative) voltage to generate, and the
                          value of 0x0FFF represents the maximum (most
                          positive) voltage to generate.  The minimum
                          and maximum voltages are determined by the
                          "amplitude" and "offset" values in the
                          ri3152a_output_arb_waveform() function.
          
                          This function shifts the value of each data
                          point left 4 places prior to loading.  This
                          is done to accommodate the 3152A hardware.
                          This causes a performance penalty over
                          the function "ri3152a_load_arb_data()".

           Description:   Displays the return status of the
                          function call.  If the function was
                          successful, it will return a status
                          of VI_SUCCESS, otherwise it will
                          return an error code.  Passing
                          the error code into the function
                          "ri3152a_error_message" will return
                          a string describing the error.

           Data Range:    each point in the array represents a single
                          DAC value.  The least significant 4 bits of
                          the DAC value should be set to 0.  The
                          DAC value thus ranges from:
          
                                0x0000 (0 decimal)      minimum to
                                0xFFFF (65535 decimal)  maximum in

  ri3152a_load_segment_binary

      ViStatus ri3152a_load_segment_binary (ViSession instrHandle,
                                            ViInt16 numberofSegments,
                                            ViInt32 waveSize[]);

  Purpose

      Panel Name: Load Segment Binary
      
      Description:
      
      This loads the segment binary data using the fast binary download
      method.  This function performs the bit / byte manipulations necessary to
      generate the segment table in the proper format.  With this function, the
      programmer merely states the number of segments to download and the size
      (in points) of each wave.
      
      
      The traditional ASCII method of downloading one waveform at a time is
      inefficient in cases where multiple waveforms have to be loaded in the
      shortest possible time.
      
      There are provisions built into the Model 3152A that allow fast binary
      downloads of waveform data.  Using this method, the memory is first
      loaded with one long waveform that is made of many smaller waveforms,
      then, using fast binary access, the segment table is downloaded to the
      generator.  The segment table contains start address and size information
      for each segment.
      
      There are a few things to consider when you prepare segment tables:
      
      1. Data for each segment must have 5 bytes.
      
      2. The number of bytes in a complete segment table must divide
         by 5.  The Model 3152A has no control over data sent to its
         port during data transfer.  Therefore, wrong data and/or
         incorrect number of bytes will cause erroneous memory
         partition.
      
      3. The start address for segment 1 is 0x1F4.
      
      4. Compute the start address for segment n" using the following
         equation:
      
         ADD(n) = ADD(n-1) + (SIZE(n-1)/2)
      
         For example, say you have 2 segments, the first is 10,000
         points.  The start address for segment number 2 is as
         follows:
      
         ADD(2) = ADD(1) + (SIZE(1)/2)
         = 500 + 10000/2 = 500 + 5000; and in hex
         = 0x1F4 + 0x1388 = 0x157C
      
      5. The segment size is entered using the actual size of the
         segment.  Do not divide the segment size as was done for the
         address.  For a size of 10,000: use 0x2710
