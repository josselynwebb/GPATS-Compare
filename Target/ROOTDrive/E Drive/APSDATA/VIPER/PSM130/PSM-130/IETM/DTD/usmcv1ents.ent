<para>The
CAGE codes are five position codes assigned to manufacturers/non-manufactures organizational entities/contractors.  The primary use of the CAGE coding system is in machine accounting operations related to support management programs, such as cataloging and standardization.  The CAGE code is used in conjunction with the firm&apos;s reference number relating the firm with the item of supply, production or design in cataloging and other supply record, as well as on engineering documentation.  These codes are essential to contract/purchase agreements and various activities/agencies automated data processing (ADP) systems.  The CAGE code and reference number are used to screen item identification against each other primarily to detect duplication.</para>
</subpara2>

<subpara2>
<title>Part Number.  (Column 5)</title>  
<para>Indicates the primary number used by
the manufacturer (individual, company, firm, corporation or government activity), which controls the design and characteristics of the item by means of its engineering drawings, specifications, standards and inspection requirements to identify an item or range of items.</para>
</subpara2> 

<subpara2>
<title>Description. (Column 6)</title>  
<para>This column contains the item
name and description of the repair part.  When an item is duplicated, the abbreviation (S/A) is inserted after the noun name to indicate "same as".  S/A items refer to the line item number of the item&apos;s first appearance in the major combination.  When an item is fabricated from other items, the abbreviation FAB FR, followed by the item required for the fabrication, is inserted after the item identification.  When an item is assembled from other items, the abbreviation ASSEM FR is used followed by each item required for the assembly of the item.  When the items comprise a kit or set, a complete list of the components will be given in alphabetical order immediately following the item, under the heading "Consist of", abbreviated (C/O).</para>

An X in the MAN column indicates it is mandatory that the item be replaced any time it is loosened or removed.  No X in either column indicates the item has no special replacement considerations other than those described in the text of this manual.</para>

<title>General</title>

<subpara2>
<para>The repair parts list pages list spares and repair parts required for performance of organizational, intermediate and depot maintenance of the &topic; system.  They authorize the requisitioning and issue of spares and repair parts as indicated by the source and maintenance codes.</para>
</subpara2>  

<subpara2>
<para>The repair parts list lists spares and repair parts authorized for use in the performance of maintenance.  The list also includes parts, which must be removed for replacement of authorized parts.  Parts lists are composed of parts in each group listed in Figure and Number sequence.</para>
</subpara2>  

<subpara2>
<para>An index in National Stock Number (NSN) sequence appears in the back of this manual.  National Stock Numbers and part numbers are cross-referenced to each illustration figure and item number.</para>

<title>Source, Maintenance and Recoverability (SM&amp;R) Codes (Column 2)</title>  
<para>This column contains a series of alphabetic letters, which denote the uniform source, maintenance and recoverability coding structure.  This Code is assigned to items subordinate to or associated with an end item, i.e., spares, repair parts and support equipment.  The uniform code format is composed of three parts consisting of a two (2) position Source Code, a two (2) position Maintenance Code and a one (1) position Recoverability Code.</para>

<para>
<seqlist>
<item><para>The code provides the user with information on each item relative to (1) the method of obtaining the item; for example, by requisition, fabrication or salvage; (2) the lowest maintenance echelon authorized to remove, replace and use the item and the lowest echelon capable to perform complete repair; and (3) disposition action on unserviceable items.</para></item>          <item><para>Definitions of SMR codes are listed below.

<title>National Stock Number (Column 3)</title>  
<para>This column furnishes
National Stock Numbers (NSNs) assigned to those centrally managed items required for support of the equipment.  When they have been assigned, NSNs will be used in all supply operations, from original purchase to final disposal of the item.  Absence of an NSN indicates the item is not normally stocked as a repair part, as indicated by the source code portion of the SMR codes.  If an item without an NSN is required, it should be determined if the item can be obtained from assembly, manufacturer or salvage by referring to the source code.  Items not stock numbered, that cannot be obtained from these sources, may be requisitioned using the manufacturer&apos;s code and part number referencing the RPL number, date of the PL and the line item number which applies.</para>

<title>Repair Parts</title>
<para>This listing presents all repair parts contained in the equipment and is numbered in sequence by component. Repair parts need not be identical with parts of the original equipment, but as replacement parts they are considered suitable or preferred.</para></subpara1>
<subpara1>
<title>Item Numbers (Column 1)</title> 
<para>This column specifies item numbers assigned in numerical sequence and in the order that each item appears in the RPL. The item numbers are provided for reference purposes. In emergencies, these item numbers may be used for RPL number and date on requisitions which combat units transmit by message.</para></subpara1>
<subpara1>
<title>Model (Column 2)</title> 
<para>This column indicates by an alphabetical code the specific application of repair parts, components, or assemblies when more than one model of an assembly, component, or equipment is contained in this publication. The absence of the code indicates that only one version of the item (assembly, component, or equipment) is covered by this RPL.</para></subpara1>
<subpara1>
<title>Stock Number (Column 3)</title> 
<para>This column furnishes National Stock Numbers (NSNs) assigned to those centrally managed items required for support of the equipment. When they have been assigned, NSNs will be used in all supply operations, from original purchase to final disposal of the item. Absence of an NSN indicates the item is not normally stocked as a repair part, as indicated by the source code portion of the SMR codes. If an item without an NSN is required, it should be determined if the item can be obtained from assembly, manufacturer or salvage by referring to the source code. Items not stock numbered, that cannot be obtained from these sources, may be requisitioned using the manufacturer&apos;s code and part number referencing the RPL number, date of the RPL and the line item number which applies.</para></subpara1>
<subpara1>
<title>Reference Designator (Column 4)</title>
<para>This column contains alphabetical and/or numerical designators for referencing an individual repair part to an illustration. The absence of a reference designator indicates there is no illustration for the part.</para></subpara1>
<subpara1>
<title>Indenture Code (Column 5)</title>
<para>This column contains the Indenture Code Letter which indicates the relationship of a line item to the end item or to the preceding component, assembly, or subassembly. Visual indentation of the line item is not shown; however, the Indenture Code Letter will enable the user of the RPL to interpret the relationship of the line item with its next higher assembly.</para>

<para>Normally, the Indenture Code Letters indicate the following relationship:</para>

<title>Item Identification (Column 6)</title> 
<para>This column contains the item name and description of the repair part. When an item is duplicated, the abbreviation (S/A) is inserted after the noun name to indicate "same as". S/A items refer to the line item number of the item&apos;s first appearance in the major combination. When an item is fabricated from other items, the abbreviation FAB FR, followed by the item required for the fabrication, is inserted after the item identification. When an item is assembled from other items, the abbreviation ASSEM FR is used, followed by each item required for the assembly of the item. When the items comprise a kit or set, a complete list of the components will be given in alphabetical order immediately following the item, under the heading "Consist of", abbreviated (C/O).</para></subpara1>
