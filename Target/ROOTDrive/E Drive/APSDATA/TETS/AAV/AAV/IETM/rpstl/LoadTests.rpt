	Load Parts Data - Input File Test Results

This test checks the RPSTL input files for problems that might
impact the way parts data is loaded.  This particular report
will only check the Section 2 tag file.

This check lists two kinds of problems in the data or structure of
the input file: 

  - WARNINGS are bad practices, missing data, or inconsistencies
    that might cause problems.
  - ERRORS will always result in problems or incorrect data.

Line numbers are provided to help you find and correct these
issues, but they may not always be exact.  If a report section
has no entries below its header, no problems were found.
