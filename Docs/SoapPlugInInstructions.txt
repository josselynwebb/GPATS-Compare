There are two sets of files: CEM side and Kernel side

For each side there is a plugin.c and plugin.h

CEM side:
	-Add plugin.c and plugin.h to the source folder of the ATXML_API project
	-Include plugin.h in AtXmlApi.cpp
	-Register the plug in by adding the call to soap_register in the atxml_Initialize() 
		function after the call to soap_init2()
	-The register call is found below
		soap_register_plugin(s_soap, plugin);

Kernel side:
	-Add plugin.c and plugin.h to the source folder of the CiclKernel project
	-Include plugin.h in AtXmlInterfaceMt.cpp
	-Register the plug in by adding the call to soap_register in the atxml_Initialize() 
		function after the call to soap_init2()
	-The register call is found below
		soap_register_plugin(s_soap, plugin);

Steps:

1.  Add the plugin files
2.  include the .h in the above mentioned classes
3.  Register the plugin
4.  Build/Compile the two projects
5.  Copy CiclKernel.exe and AtXmlApi.dll
6.  Add the new Dll and exe file to VIPER
7.  After running the test the results can be found in c:/aps/data
	There will be a file for each send and receive that occurs, 
	the file will labeled as to if it is CEM or Kernel side.
